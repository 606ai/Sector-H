## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Conda or Miniconda
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sector-h.git
   cd sector-h
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_env.sh
   ```

3. Create and configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp api/.env.example api/.env
   # Edit api/.env with your credentials
   ```

## 💻 Development

### Starting the Development Environment

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Or start specific services
docker-compose up api website
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test modules
pytest api/tests/test_ml/
```

## 🧠 ML Modules

### Multi-Agent Systems
```python
from api.ml.multi_agent import Environment

# Create a multi-agent environment
env = Environment(num_agents=3)
env.reset()
```

### Causal Learning
```python
from api.ml.causal import Discovery

# Discover causal relationships
discovery = Discovery()
graph = discovery.learn_structure(data)
```

### Meta-Learning
```python
from api.ml.meta_learning import Reptile

# Train a meta-learning model
model = Reptile(inner_lr=0.1)
model.meta_train(tasks)
```
